Array Methods:
Sort an Array – used to rearrange contents of an array into a certain order. 
Ex: strings would be alpha, numerical values would be from smallest to largest. 	
Its an auto sort function using .sort
Ex: array_name.sort – this would sort strings into alpha and numbers into ascending 
This is not permanent, but you can assign a variable to it. Ex: sorted_array = array_name.sort 
This will give you two copies of the same array one sorted, one not 
Reverse an Array – puts array in opposite order using .reverse instead of .sort
Ex. Array_name.reverse 
First and last element finder
Using .first and .last will return the first and last element respectfully
EX: array_name.first  => element at index 0, array_name.last => element at index -1 
***does not change original array***

Find out if an element is in an array
for this you use the .include? note the ? , you are gonna then put your query Inside of a parenthesis as a string. This will return true or false if that element is inside of your array. 
Ex. array_name.include?(“element”) => true/false 

Finding size of an array 
Sometimes youll need to know the size of an array. Adding .size at the end will return the number of elements in the array. All methods are case sensitive. 
Ex: array_name.size => 3 (will return 3 elements if there are a3 elements 4 if 4 and so on)
